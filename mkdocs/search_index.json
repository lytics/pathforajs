It integrates with your \nLytics\n account to track user actions, and conditionally display modules based on your users' audience membership. This documentation will walk you through everything you need to create your own highly customized and personalized module. Code and live preview examples are provided along the way.\n\n\nGetting Started\n\n\nBefore you begin creating modules with Pathfora you must add the \nLytics javascript tag\n to your website. If you are using \nLytics Personalization\n to power your modules, Pathfora will be automatically loaded through your Lytics javascript tag. If you're creating a custom module, the Pathfora tag must be loaded after the Lytics tag.\n\n\n!-- Your Lytics JS Tag --\n\n\nscript src=\nhttps://c.lytics.io/api/tag/YOUR LYTICS ACCOUNT ID/lio.js\n/script\n\n\n\n!-- Pathfora Tag --\n\n\nscript src=\nhttp://c.lytics.io/static/pathfora.min.js\n/script\n\n\n\n\n\nNext you'll need to set up configuration for your module and initialize it with \ninitializeWidgets\n.
