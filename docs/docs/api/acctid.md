Pathfora integrates with [Lytics](http://www.getlytics.com/) to support its [content recommendations](/layouts/modal.md#recommend) feature.

## Using your Lytics Account ID

To use this feature you will need to know your Lytics Account ID. This account ID should be the same as the one in the Lytics javascript tag. This is the string value you can use for the second parameter in [initializeWidgets](/api/methods.md#initializewidgets).

You will also need to make sure that any domain you want to use Pathfora on is whitelisted in your account, you can contact your customer success representative `success@getlytics.com` to do this. Your account should already have any domain whitelisted with the Lytics javascript tag installed on it, but be sure to include your local and testing environments.
